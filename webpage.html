<h2><p id="githubworkflow">The GitHub Workflow</p></h2>
<p>GitHub is a website that helps <i>organise coding projects</i>. A project's code is stored in a repository.</p>
<ol>
    <li>A commit is a version of the code that you save to the repository. Once you've made changes to the code, you can use a commit to add those changes to the repository. GitHub will save the new version of the code separately, so you can compare it to other versions later.</li>
    <li>A branch is a copied version of the code that you can safely work on without breaking the project. Create a branch when you want to change something, and when you're finished you can merge it back into the main branch to implement the changes.</li>
    <li>A pull request is when you open up the changes you've made to other people so they can help you improve the code. People can comment on pull requests, and even on individual lines of code.</li>
    <li>You can do all of this through the Unix Shell without leaving the software you use for coding.</li>
</ol>

<h2><p id="unixshell">The Unix Shell description</p></h2>
<p>The Unix Shell is a way to manipulate files and directories on your computer. It's less intuitive than a graphical user interface (GUI), but it lets you do things that you can't in a GUI.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To list the files in a directory, use the command: ls</li>
    <li>To show the working directory, use the command: pwd. This stands for "print working directory".</li>
    <li>To create a new directory, use the command: mkdir. This stands for "make directory".</li>
    <li>To create a file, you can use the command: touch [name of file]. This will create an empty file for you.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, you can use the command: nano [name of file]. This will open the file in nano, a basic text editor, for you. You can edit the file and save it, then go back to the command line.</li>
</ul>
